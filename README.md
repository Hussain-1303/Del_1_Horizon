Developed a console based "GoFish" game in attempt of polishing my developing methodologies.

Tech Stack Used :
NetBeans used to code the logic of the game.
Visual Paradign used to create Class Diagrams and User Case Diagrams.
Git used to control versioning of our application.

Java was the core language used to code the logic.
